Users can create accounts, rate songs, and save them to their personal music library. The platform highlights top average-rated songs and current top charting tracks.

## Tech stack
We built the frontend with HTML, CSS and Javascript. We utilized a SQL database and PHP to store user data and song ratings in the backend. We retrieved song and music chart data by integrating the Last.FM API.
