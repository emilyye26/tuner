# Tuner - A comprehensive music rating platform

## What it does
Tuner is a social music rating platform that allows users to browse through music, rate songs of their choice and view the ratings of other users. A user authentication system allows users to create an account and rate songs under their own profile, saving their rated songs to their own music library in which users can view past ratings. The home page displays the top average rated songs along with the current top charting songs. 

## How we built it
We built the front-end with HTML, CSS and Javascript. We utilized a SQL database and PHP to store user data and song ratings. We retrieved song and music chart datafrom the Last.FM API.
